## Overview of Training Topics
### Building a Basic Web Service in Python
- There are a number of libraries/frameworks available to build web services in
Python.  The two most popular are [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and 
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/).

- We will be using Flask (it's easier to get started with) to build a simple
API that allows use to list, create, update, and even delete a list of our
friends.

### Enhancing our Friends API
- After we get our basic functionality up and running, we'll make some
enhancements to our API that would standard features of a real-world program:
    - A database to hold our friendship info so that it persists between
    program runs.
    
    - Some sort of authentication requirement so that random people (or 
    machines!) can't change your list of friends.
